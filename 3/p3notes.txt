Phase 1:
 - Possible winners are put into G groups. Each group going through this process.
 - Members of a group will be numbered from 1 to p (amount of people).
 - They will be arranged in a circle. 1, 2, 3...p, 1 and so on.
 - Each group has its own skip number, s, and threshold number, t, where t < p.
 - To eliminate someone from the group, you start at person 1 and skip over s people. Then the person following this person is eliminated.
 - Because the line is circular, once you pass the highest numbered person in the line you will continue with the lowest.
 - Continue eliminating people in this fashion until there are precisely t people left.

Phase 2:
 - The winner of the lottery is the smallest numbered person left from all the groups.
 - If there are multiple people with the same lowest number, then the person from the lowest group number is the winner.

The problem:
 - Determine the winner of the lottery (group number and person number).
 - Print a log for each group of which people get eliminated, in the order they are eliminated.

Input: 
 - The first line will contain a single positive int n, n <= 25, representing the number of input cases.

 - The first line of each input case will contain a single positive int g, g <= 10, representing the number of groups.

 - The following g lines will each contain information about each group.
    The ith line will contain information about group number i, 1 <= i <= g.

 - These lines will each contain 3 ints separated by spaces.
    p (2 <= p <= 10^5): the number of people.
    s (0 <= s <= p): the skip number.
    t (1 <= t <= p): the threshold number.
1
5
10 2 2
8 1 1
7 2 3
5 1 3
9 1 4

 - The sum of s(p - t) over all the groups will be <= 10^7. This means you wont have to move forwards from node to node more than 10^7 times in phase 1. (idk)

Output:
 - For each group, print out the following header on a line by itself: "Group #x:"
 - x is the 1 based number of the group (i + 1).
 - Following this will be the people eliminated, one per line, in the order they are eliminated.
 - This will all be printed in order by group number without any blank lines separating each group.
 - Following this will be a line in the format: "Lottery winner is person k from group g."
 - k is the number of the person (1 based) and g is the group number (1 based).
